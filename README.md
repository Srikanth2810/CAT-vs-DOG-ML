# CAT vs DOG Image Classification

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify images into either cats or dogs. The model was trained using a dataset containing 1 GB of cat and dog images. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 97.2% on the testing dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of cat and dog images totaling 1 GB. The images were preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Model Training

The machine learning model was trained using the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to enhance model generalization.

2. **Model Architecture:** A neural network model, possibly using convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, was designed for image classification.

3. **Training:** The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.

4. **Evaluation:** The trained model was evaluated on a separate testing dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 97.2% on the testing dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying cat and dog images.

## Usage

To test the model with multiple images like above, run `testing.py`
